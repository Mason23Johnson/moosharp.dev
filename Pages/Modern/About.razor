            <span class="code-tag">// Who?</span><br />
            I'm <strong>Mason Johnson</strong> — a full-stack developer driven by clarity, speed, and real-world utility.
            I craft systems that feel <span class="emphasis">clean</span>, <span class="emphasis">fast</span>, and <span class="emphasis">intentional</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="code-tag">// stack</span><br />
            My main tools include <span class="stack">C#</span>, <span class="stack">ASP.NET</span>, <span class="stack">Blazor</span>, 
            <span class="stack">Entity Framework</span>, and <span class="stack">Docker</span>.
            I bridge scalable APIs to responsive interfaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="code-tag">// mission</span><br />
            I build for clients, friends, small businesses, and more. The goal is always the same:
            Make a visually attractive, easy-to-use, and interactive experience.
        </p>

            <span class="code-tag">// What is MooSharp?</span><br />
            MooSharp is my personal brand, portfolio, and company. 
            It reflects my journey as a developer and shows my skills and interests through my alias.
            Moo comes from LambdaMOO, a software my father coded with in the 90s.    
        </p>

            <span class="code-tag">// personal</span><br />
            I got married to my beautiful wife in July, 2024 and went to the virgin islands for our honeymoon.
            It was an absolutely amazing trip and I can't wait for our next one. I love coding, woodworking, and playing pickleball.
            I enjoy creating adaptive websites, coding and playing indie games. I enjoy spending time outdoors on the farm and listening to music.
        </p>
